## Partner Intro

### Primary contact

> Ashkan Mirzaei (ashkan@cs.toronto.edu), PhD student

### Parter organization

Toronto Intelligent Systems lab is a place for computer scientists and creative thinkers to come together and design the next generation of algorithms for robotic intelligence. The lab is located at the University of Toronto and led by Igor Gilitschenski. The lab works on broad applications related to intelligent systems, but for Ashkan specifically, he is interested in content creation with 3D objects and making 3D objects as accessible as possible.

## Description about the project

An easy-to-use web application for 3D content creation from a user-given text prompt. It features a gallery of existing 3D creations and an option to generate new 3D content from text input.

## Key Features

- A clear call-to-action to generate new 3D content and a input text box to enter the prompt
- A searchable gallery featuring previously generated objects
- An interactable panel with the 3D object

*This section is in progress and will be completed once we start development.*
​
## Instructions
<!-- >* Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 >* How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 >* Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 >* This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully. -->

*This section will be completed once we start development.*
 
## Development requirements
<!-- >* What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 >* Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 >* You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started. -->

*This section will be completed once we start development.*
 
## Deployment 
<!-- >* Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 >* What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how? -->

*This section will be completed once we start development.*
