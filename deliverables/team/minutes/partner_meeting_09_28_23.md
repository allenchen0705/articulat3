## Meeting Agenda
- Review User Stories
  - Feedback: Overall sounds good
  - We don't want the user to configure the model type
    - We want to provide the best option in the end
    - For now, use dream fusion, disable fusion?
      - This can eliminate the settings button in the designs
    - For now, use the default settings
  - Review (Figma prototype)[https://www.figma.com/file/PiuZtndJxjyLuyAER2jeSh/Website-Prototype?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=rdSoRG59po0iTZgO-1]
    - No video needed for "create"
    - Need to show progress
      - Starts by showing the image and update as we go through the training
      - After the training is completed, we only include 3D object
    - Export as button always contains image and mesh option only
    - Remove settings, only use the best/easier model
  - Further questions
    - Product name ideas
      - Feedback: Anything is good
    - Github - share repo to Ashkan
    - Threestudio deployment
      - If their self-deployment won't work
        - Can run on node GPU; if we can't get access to this, he may be able to help us
