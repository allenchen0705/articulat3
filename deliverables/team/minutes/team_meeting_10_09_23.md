## Meeting Agenda
- Divide our project and create sub-teams. (Choose user story for each sub-team and discuss what feature we want to complete)
  - Dividing our project in 2 sub-teams
  - Sub-team 1: Frontend
    - Cast: Jasper, Neeco, Sarah
    - Idea: refined frontend with ‚Äúbarebones‚Äù backend
    - User Story of focus:
      - User story #1 (As a content creator, I want to generate a 3D graphic according to a desired description in order to save time and effort in designing and creating it myself.)
      - Create the input page and have ‚Äúfake backend‚Äù - ie. timer of 5 seconds then a default picture comes up
      - Note: we should show that the input data is processed and saved within a local variable which will be used to ‚Äúpass towards the backend‚Äù
    - Sub-team 2: Backend
      - Cast: Allen, Max, Steven
      - Idea: refined backend with no frontend, just swagger
      - User Story of focus:
        - Ideas
          - Make an endpoint for prompt 
          - Take in prompt from JSON data and then writes it to a SQL database
- Technologies for each sub-team
  - Sub-team 1: Frontend
    - React, TS, node, possibly shadcn for components
  - Sub-team 2: Backend

        - Add technologies used
      - Splitting into frontend and backend parts
