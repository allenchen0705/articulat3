## Partner Intro

### Primary Contact

> Ashkan Mirzaei (ashkan@cs.toronto.edu), PhD student

### Partner Organization

Toronto Intelligent Systems lab is a place for computer scientists and creative thinkers to come together and design the next generation of algorithms for robotic intelligence. The lab is located at the University of Toronto and led by Igor Gilitschenski. The lab works on broad applications related to intelligent systems, but for Ashkan specifically, he is interested in content creation with 3D objects and making 3D objects as accessible as possible.

## Description About the Project

An easy-to-use web application for 3D content creation from a user-given text prompt. It features a gallery of existing 3D creations that can be browsed for inspiration and a create page to easily generate any desired 3D graphic from text input: a great, open-sourced solution for content creators, video game developers, and designers to quickly grab customized 3D graphics for their products! 

## Key Features

üì¢ _A clear call-to-action to create new 3D content using an input text box to enter the prompt_

  With this feature, users will be able to type in a prompt that describes the kind of 3D graphic they desire. Entering that prompt will immediately start the generation process and present to the user the finalized 3D graphic once the process completes.
  
üñºÔ∏è _A searchable gallery featuring previously generated objects_

  With this feature, users will be able to browse through all previously generated 3D objects by any previous user on the web application. This gallery is also searchable, allowing users to narrow down their search to be more personalized to their needs and only view items that are similar to their search input. 

üìÅ _An interactable panel of 3D objects and an option to export the image and object‚Äã files_

  With this feature, users will be able to click on any 3D object (either generated from Key Feature 1 or a previously generated object from Key Feature 2) and play around with an interactable panel of the specific object. They will also be able to export the clicked object's thumbnail image (.png), model file (.obj), material file (.mtl), or texture file (.jpeg) depending on their needs. 

## Instructions
<!-- >* Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 >* How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 >* Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 >* This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully. -->

### Creating a New 3D Graphic

If you are looking to create a new 3D object to use in your product, follow these steps:
1. Go to our web application using this [link](url).
2. You‚Äôll be welcomed to our Create page. Here, you may enter a description of the 3D graphic you desire in the input bar. 

<img width="1436" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 5 41 34 PM" src="https://github.com/csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m/assets/60327675/033841a5-1385-4fff-a65d-cde683a0c8bd">


3. For example, if you need a 3D graphic of a hamburger, you may type in ‚ÄúA juicy hamburger‚Äù in the input bar. 

4. Once you‚Äôre done, press enter or click the Create button.

6. You‚Äôll need to wait a couple of minutes for our model to completely generate your 3D graphic. During the process of the 3D generation, you‚Äôll only be able to see a loading symbol.

7. Once the object is finished generating, your customized 3D object will appear instead of the loading symbol. Now you have your 3D object!

### Searching for 3D Inspiration

If you are looking to gather inspiration or search for existing 3D graphics, follow these steps: 
1. Go to our web application using this [link](url) if you haven‚Äôt already.
2. Click on the Gallery tab in our navigation bar. This will take you to our Gallery page.

3. Feel free to use the Search bar to narrow down what you‚Äôre looking for. Or just scroll through this page to look for any kind of inspiration by viewing all the previously generated 3D objects by other users.

### Interacting With and Exporting your 3D Object

After generating a 3D object, if you are looking to interact with the object or export the object files, follow these steps:
1. (Following from step 4 in Creating a New 3D Graphic) click the download button on the top right of the object card. 

<img width="1436" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-19 at 5 46 51 PM" src="https://github.com/csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m/assets/60327675/a4601759-267d-48e9-b6fe-480c8bf73d06">

2. This will open up a dropdown menu to allow you to export any files you need.

3. You may also rotate or zoom in/out of your generated object inside the object card.

## Development Requirements
<!-- >* What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 >* Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 >* You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started. -->

### Installation

In order to set up your local environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m.git
```

2. Install Nix

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix && echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

3. Run Nix

```bash
nix develop
```

### Usage

For the following commands, make sure that you are running nix (as shown [above](#installation)). Also, make sure that the following commands are running in separate terminals.

Starting the client:
```bash
cd client
pnpm run dev
```

Starting the server:
```bash
TEMPORAL_SERVER_HOST_PORT=4.tcp.ngrok.io:12540 go run cmd/main.go
```

### Testing

When running tests, make sure that you are running nix (as shown [above](#installation)). 

Frontend testing:
```bash
# pnpm run test will ask you to install jsdom. Install and re-run the tests
pnpm run test
```

Backend testing:
```bash
go test ./...
```
 
## Deployment and Github Workflow
<!-- >* Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.‚Äã
>* Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
>* If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
>* Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
>* What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
>* Don't forget to briefly justify why you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

#### Deployment Tools

#### Our Github Workflow

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines

For our Typescript code, we will be using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) rules similar to those of [Shopify](https://github.com/Shopify/web-configs/tree/main)‚Äôs. 

For our Go code, we will be following the standards from [Mattermost](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/more-info/server/style-guide/). The rust code will be checked by [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy). 

A pre-commit hook will lint and eslinttest all parts of the project.
