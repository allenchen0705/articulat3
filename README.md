## What is articulat3?

[articulate](https://articulat3.com/) is an easy-to-use web application for 3D content creation based on a user-given text prompt. It features a "Gallery" page of existing 3D creations that can be browsed for inspiration and a "Create" page to easily generate a 3D graphic from text input. The product is a convenient, open-source solution for content creators, video game developers, and designers to quickly grab customized 3D graphics for their products.

## Partner Intro

### Primary Contact

> Ashkan Mirzaei (ashkan@cs.toronto.edu), PhD student

### Partner Organization

[Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab](https://tisl.cs.toronto.edu/) is a collaborative space for computer scientists and creative thinkers to envision the future of algorithms for robotic intelligence. The lab is located at the University of Toronto, where teams work on broad applications related to intelligent systems, led by Igor Gilitschenski. Ashkan Mirzaei is specifically interested in content creation with 3D objects. In collaboration with Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab and Ashkan, articulat3 contributes to the shared goal of making 3D object generation as accessible as possible to the general public.

## Key Features and Use Cases

### üì¢ _An input bar to enter a prompt and generate new 3D content_

Users can type a prompt that describes the 3D graphic they desire. Entering the prompt immediately starts the generation process and presents the user with the finalized 3D graphic once the process is complete.

Generating 3D objects is perfect for content creators who want to save time, as opposed to the alternative of having to learn complex 3D programs. [See User Story #1](./deliverables/D1/planning.md/#story-1)

Currently, we show the object generation progress by updating the thumbnail in step intervals. In the future, a suggested extension is to include a progress bar for more continuous progress updates. [See User Story #2](./deliverables/D1/planning.md/#story-2).

### üñºÔ∏è _A searchable gallery featuring previously generated objects_

Users can browse through all previously generated 3D objects by any user on articulat3. This gallery is also searchable, allowing users to filter their browsing to their immediate needs and only display items similar to their search query.

Content creators can benefit from other users' creations for inspiration when making their own content. [See User Story #3](./deliverables/D1/planning.md/#story-3)

### üìÅ _An interactable panel of 3D objects and an option to export the image and object‚Äã files_

Users can click on 3D objects (their own, or other users' objects) and engage with them in an interactive panel. They can export the object's thumbnail image (.png), model file (.obj), material file (.mtl), and texture file (.jpg) depending on their needs.

Video game designers will benefit from the interactive object canvas, allowing them to effortlessly inspect an asset from various angles and zoom levels. [See User Story #4](./deliverables/D1/planning.md/#story-4)

Hardware creators can also use their 3D object immediately with the ability to quickly export the object as various file types. [See User Story #5](./deliverables/D1/planning.md/#story-5)

## How to Use articulat3

### Creating a New 3D Graphic

If you are looking to create a new 3D object, follow these steps:

1. Go to [articulat3](https://www.159.203.51.70.sslip.io). Please note that the certificate is invalid so you must click to the Advanced section and proceed, to enter the web app.
2. You‚Äôll be welcomed to the Create page. Here, enter a description of the 3D graphic you desire in the input bar. For example, if you need a 3D graphic of a hamburger, type ‚ÄúA juicy hamburger‚Äù. Be as descriptive as you'd like.

### Searching for 3D Inspiration

If you are looking to gather inspiration or search for existing 3D graphics, follow these steps:

1. Go to [articulat3](https://www.159.203.51.70.sslip.io/gallery) if you haven‚Äôt already.
2. Click on the Gallery tab in the top navigation bar. This will take you to the Gallery page.

## Development Requirements

<!-- >* What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 >* Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 >* You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started. -->

### Installation

In order to set up your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:csc301-2023-fall/project-44-toronto-intelligence-m.git
```

2. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download)

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix && echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

3. Run Nix

```bash
nix develop
```

### Usage

The following environment variables need to be exported. Ensure that you are in the staging workspace for both gcloud and digitalocean.

```bash
cd terraform/digitalocean
export TEMPORAL_SERVER_HOST_PORT="$(terraform output -raw public_ip_address):7233"
```

```bash
cd terraform/gcloud
terraform output -raw cs_creds > ../../secrets/credentials.json
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=secrets/credentials.json
export GCS_BUCKET_NAME=articulate-store-staging
```

Starting the server:

```bash
PORT=8080 go run cmd/main.go
```

### Testing

When running tests, ensure you are running Nix (as shown [above](#installation)).

Frontend testing:

```bash
# pnpm run test will ask you to install jsdom. Install and re-run the tests
pnpm run test
```

Backend testing:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Deployment and Github Workflow

<!-- >* Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.‚Äã
>* Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
>* If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
>* Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
>* What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
>* Don't forget to briefly justify why you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!
